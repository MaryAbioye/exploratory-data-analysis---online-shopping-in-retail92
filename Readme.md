## Project Description
This project demonstrates how to connect to an AWS RDS database, extract data using Python, and perform essential data manipulation and storage operations. The project aims to enhance my skills in database handling, data engineering, and Python programming.

### Key Features:
- Establishing a connection to AWS RDS using SQLAlchemy.
- Extracting data from the `customer_activity` table into Pandas DataFrames.
- Storing data locally in `.csv` format for efficient analysis.
- Loading data into a DataFrame for further exploration and visualization.

### What I Learned:
- Handling database credentials securely with YAML files.
- Using SQLAlchemy to manage database connections.
- Saving and loading data efficiently with Pandas.
- Analysing and transforming data
